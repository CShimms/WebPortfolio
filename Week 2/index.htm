            <h2>About Ibrahim Lincoln-Mercury Dealer</h2>
            
            <p>Abraham Lincoln, like most Gen Z idiots, owned 12 fidget-spinners and only traveled by electric scooter. He always shouted <a href="https://youtu.be/1qjtugr2618?si=wKhVhkF4sd2XW5HX&t=10">"Where the hell are the commissioners?"</a> for some reason. </p>
	    <p>Where most Zoomers are content to rest on their nihilistic, meme-sharing laurels, Lincoln aspired to more. He wanted to be a Gen X rock star who added rap for some odd reason. Unfortunately, he was already too late for that, so he'll have to build a time machine at some point so he will have traveled back in time to the 90s to start Linkin Park after the end of <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1631096/by-position">his successful NBA career</a>. I think after 26 years, he'll travel back in time again to win the Civil War and get shot by John Wilkes Booth, which is a weird way to choose to die when you have a time machine, but I guess the play was that good.</p>

                <li>Received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, which is <mark><em>weird</em></mark>, because I don't think India existed back then</li>
